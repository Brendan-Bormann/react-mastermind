## React MasterMind

This is a react-built variation of the poplular boardgame `Mastermind`

The goal of this project is to utilize React's state and component structure to create a quick and dynamic game experience.

## Rules

When the game starts, the computer will choose four random colors.

Your goal is to guess all four of them.

After each guess, you'll get feedback on your guess.
  - Part correct: This means a number of your guesses are the _correct_ __color__, but _wrong_ __location__.

  - Fully correct: This means a number of your guesses are the correct __color__ _and_ __location__.

You have ten chances to get the answer correctly.

When you have guessed correctly, you will recieve a win which is stored in localStorage.

## God speed.
